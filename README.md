# Module 2 Challenge

# Overview
In this project, the goal was to refactor a VBA code in Microsoft Excel to collect specific stock information in two different years, 2017 and 2018.

# Data 
The data used has two charts with information on 12 different stocks. The stock information contains a ticker value, the date the stock was issued, the opening, closing and adjusted closing price, the highest and lowest price, and the volume of the stock. The focus is to retrieve the ticker, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock.

# Analysis
As far as analysis, I followed the instructions as prime as possible while checking for any important details regarding variables and loops.

#Advantages and Disadvantages
Although the code is as easy with the touch of a button, Its only disandvantage is the time it can take to read the information and may come to be inconsistent depending on the size of the information that is required to be pulled.
